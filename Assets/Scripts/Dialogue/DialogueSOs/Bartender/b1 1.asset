  dialogue:
  - Have you ever seen this tattoo before?
  - I've seen it on some of our customers.
  - Why are you researching this tattoo?
  - It's top secret, it's a state secret, but if it's between us, I'll tell you right
    away.
  - It will definitely stay between us
  - We think it's the symbol of a terrorist group we're investigating.
  - There was a boy who hung out with the orange-haired girl sitting behind you.
    I saw this tattoo on him too, you can ask him if you want.
